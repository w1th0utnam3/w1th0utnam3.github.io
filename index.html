	Welcome to my profile
</h3>

<p>
	<b>Now working with the FEniCS project in Google Summer of Code 2018! <a href="https://w1th0utnam3.github.io/gsoc18/">See my blog.</a></b>
</p>

<p>
	I'm a student at RWTH Aachen University in Germany where I attend
	<a href="https://www.ces.rwth-aachen.de/"><b>Computational Engineering Science</b></a> classes since 2013. 
	Presumably, I am going to finish my master's degree in early 2019. 
	Apart from learning about the essentials of mechanical engineering, mathematics and computer science, 
	I gained practical experience with <b>C++</b> (high performance computing and modern template meta
	programming) and <b>Qt</b> during courses and assignments. I extended my knowledge in these areas especially 
	during my time at the <a href="http://www.ifas.rwth-aachen.de/html/00_general/main.php?lang=en"><b>IFAS</b></a> (Institute for fluid 
	power drives and controls) where I worked on the code of a simulation tool. Furthermore, I collected a lot of
	experience in <b>Python</b> for scientific computing during my bachelor thesis. This includes the core language
	as well as common libraries like NumPy, SciPy, Pandas and libraries to build Qt interfaces for Python tools.<br>
	In my spare time I love travelling and taking <b>photos</b> or working on personal <b>coding projects</b> as well as
	playing video games.

	Projects at university
</h3>

<p>During my studies I worked on a couple of projects either in a team or on my own. The most notable are</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<b>Fall 2016 to Spring 2017: Bachelor thesis</b> - <i>Extension of an application for thermal
		analysis of satellites</i><br>
		Keywords: heat equation, system of stiff nonlinear differential equations,
		Qt interface in Python, <a href="https://computation.llnl.gov/projects/sundials/cvode">CVODE</a> ODE solver<br>
		Tasks included choosing numerical methods to efficiently solve a the heat equation with
		with (nonlinear) radiative heat transfer terms. The discretization typically consisted of 100 to 10000 nodes and
		the focus was on the efficiency of the implementation. To allow engineers to use the solver, its parameters and
		some post-processing features were integrated into a Qt-based interface.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>2014-2016: IFAS valveplate/cylinderblock project</b> - As part of a project examining losses in hydraulic 
		pumps at IFAS, I supported the development of an application used to analyze the behavior of a critical bearing 
		contact. My tasks included modeling of physical effects for the simulation and implementing the 
		mathematical backend and a Qt frontend. A paper on the project was published at 
		<a href="http://www.ifk2016.com/program.php?page=single_abstract&id=F-1">IFK 2016</a>.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Summer 2016: Modeling of offshore windturbine wakes</b> - During a group project at <a href="http://www.mathcces.rwth-aachen.de/"><b>MathCCES</b></a>
		I examined models to predict the wake of offshore windturbines and their effect on subsequent turbines. The 
		focus of the project was to find a model which is suitable for large scale optimiazation problems. 
		We derived and implemented a finite volume discretization of the two-dimensional <i>Eddy Viscosity</i> wake
		model and made comparisons with an OpenFOAM model using the <a href="https://nwtc.nrel.gov/SOWFA">SOWFA</a>
		toolbox.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>2015: TrussSimulator</b> - As part of my degree, students have to complete an assignment in a team to develop a small 
		application with an engineering background. The goal is to get familiar with all stages of software 
		development including engineering, implementation, testing and documentation. Our task was to develop an easy to use 
		tool that allows the user to construct a two-dimensional truss and to compute its deformation under load. The tool is 
		written in C++ and uses the Qt library for the interface and <a href="https://computation.llnl.gov/projects/sundials/kinsol">SUNDIALS KINSOL</a> 
		as a nonlinear solver. Unfortunately we were not allowed to share our git repository due to the assignment 
		character of the project.

Programming
</h3>

<p>In my spare time I am working on some projects hosted at github with my account <a href="https://github.com/w1th0utnam3" class="user-mention">@w1th0utnam3</a>:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/w1th0utnam3/noname_tools">noname_tools</a> - a collection of C++ headers with useful methods and algorithms I wrote for other projects. I'm currently working on a C++11/14 std::variant implementation.</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/w1th0utnam3/linear_algebra_containers">linear_algebra_containers</a> - templated classes like matrix, vector and quaternion without any fancy optimiazations like expression templates</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/w1th0utnam3/undirected_graph">undirected_graph</a> - an undirected graph container written in C++ with an STL like interface</li>
</ul>

If you scrolled through my <a href="https://twitter.com/w1th0utnam3/status/453153242395205632">tweets</a> you 
<a href="https://twitter.com/w1th0utnam3/status/509785996511432704">might</a> have 
<a href="https://twitter.com/w1th0utnam3/status/452089472797380608">noticed</a> that I love taking screenshots of games
and capturing the atmosphere of them. Certainly this is also exciting outside of virtual worlds. Years ago my father
gifted me his first DSLR and playing around with it got me hooked. I try to improve my photography skills on vacations
and share the progress on my <a href="https://500px.com/w1th0utnam3">500px</a> profile.</p>
