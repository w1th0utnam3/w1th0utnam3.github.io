<a id="welcome-to-my-profile" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-my-profile" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to my profile</h3>

<p>Currently I'm studying at RWTH Aachen, Germany. Since 2013 I am
attending <a href="http://www.ces.rwth-aachen.de/"><b>Computational Engineering Science</b></a>
classes at the university. In the next semesters I want to specialize in fluid dynamics possibly with the application in aerospace engineering. Apart from
foundations of mechanical engineering I learned a lot about programming with <b>C++</b> and <b>Qt</b> during my
studies and assignments. I deepened my knowledge in these areas especially during my time at the <a href="http://www.ifas.rwth-aachen.de/html/00_general/main.php?lang=en"><b>IFAS</b></a>
(Institute for fluid power drives and controls) where I worked on the code of a simulation tool.
In my spare time I love to travel and take <b>photos</b> or work on personal <b>coding projects</b> and I enjoy video games.</p>

<a id="projects" class="anchor" href="#projects" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Projects at university</h3>
<p>During my studies I worked on some projects either in a team or alone. In the following years a big group assignment, an internship as well as my bachelor thesis will contribute to this list.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>2015: TrussSimulator</b> - As part of my degree students have to work in a team to create a small application with a background in engineering. The goal is to get familiar with all stages of software development from design to programming to testing. Our task was to create an easy to use program that allows the user to draw a two-dimensional truss and computes its deformation under load. We wrote the code in C++ with usage of the Qt library and <a href="https://computation.llnl.gov/casc/sundials/description/description.html#descr_kinsol">Sundials Kinsol</a> as a nonlinear solver.
Unfortunately we are not allowed to make our repository public due to the exercise character of the project.
</li>
<li>
<b>2015-now: IFAS valveplate/cylinderblock project</b> - As part of a project examining losses in hydraulic pumps at IFAS, I work on the implementation of a model for the behavior of a major bearing contact.
My tasks include simplification of physical effects for the simulation and coding of the mathematical backend as well as the Qt interface. The most recent paper of the project was published at <a href="http://www.ifk2016.com/program.php?page=single_abstract&id=F-1">IFK 2016</a>.
</li>
</ul>

<a id="programming" class="anchor" href="#programming" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Programming</h3>

<p>In my spare time I am working on some projects hosted at github with my account <a href="https://github.com/w1th0utnam3" class="user-mention">@w1th0utnam3</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a href="https://github.com/w1th0utnam3/noname_tools">noname_tools</a> - a collection of C++ headers with useful methods and algorithms I wrote for other projects I worked on</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/w1th0utnam3/linear_algebra_containers">linear_algebra_containers</a> - templated classes like matrix, vector and quaternion in C++ for small calculations and computer graphics</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/w1th0utnam3/undirected_graph">undirected_graph</a> - an undirected graph container written in C++ with an STL like interface</li>
</ul>

If you scrolled through my <a href="https://twitter.com/w1th0utnam3/status/453153242395205632">tweets</a> you <a href="https://twitter.com/w1th0utnam3/status/509785996511432704">might</a> have <a href="https://twitter.com/w1th0utnam3/status/452089472797380608">noticed</a> that I love taking screenshots of games. Of course this does not come out of nowhere. Years ago my father gave me his first DSLR on my birthday and since then I was into photography. Every beginning is difficult but especially on my last journeys I took some pretty nice photos. I have a profile on <a href="https://500px.com/w1th0utnam3">500px</a> where I upload some of them.</p>
