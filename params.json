{"name":"Fabian LÃ¶schner","tagline":"Portfolio","body":"### Welcome to my profile\r\nI am a student at the RWTH University in Aachen, Germany. Since 2013 I am studying [Computational Engineering Science](http://www.ces.rwth-aachen.de/) there and in the coming semesters I want to specialize in aerospace engineering. Besides engineering topics I learned a lot about programming with C++ and Qt during my studies especially during my time at the [IFAS](http://www.ifas.rwth-aachen.de/html/00_general/main.php?lang=en) (Institute for fluid power drives and controls).\r\nAdditionally we worked on a programming assignment covering all aspects of software engineering from design to programming to testing. I hope I will be able to upload our work soon on github.\r\nIn my spare time I love to take photos or work on personal coding projects.\r\n\r\n### Programming\r\nI am working on some projects hosted at github with my account @w1th0utnam3:\r\n - [linear_algebra_containers](https://github.com/w1th0utnam3/linear_algebra_containers) - types like matrix, vector and quaternion for small calculations and computer graphics\r\n - [undirected_graph](https://github.com/w1th0utnam3/undirected_graph) - an undirected graph STL like container\r\n\r\n### Photography\r\n![Photos from my 500px profile](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CJoTswlWUAAX_zE.png)\r\nIf you scrolled through my [tweets](https://twitter.com/w1th0utnam3/status/453153242395205632) you [might](https://twitter.com/w1th0utnam3/status/509785996511432704) have [noticed](https://twitter.com/w1th0utnam3/status/452089472797380608) that I love taking screenshots of games. Of course this does not come out of nowhere. Years ago my father gave me his first DSLR on my birthday and since then I was into photography. Every beginning is difficult but especially on my last journeys I took some pretty nice photos. I have a profile on [500px](https://500px.com/w1th0utnam3) where I upload some of them.\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nIf you want to contact me you can write to my university mail address: [fabian.loeschner@rwth-aachen.de](mailto:fabian.loeschner@rwth-aachen.de) or send me a private message at [twitter](https://twitter.com/w1th0utnam3).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
